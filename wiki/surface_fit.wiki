|| {{{ fit_schedule [double] }}} || Temperature (exponential) decay constant for parameter annealing during surface fitting. *(default = 0.999)* ||
|| {{{ fit_max_energy [double] }}} || Maximum energy values to be considered during surin two weeksface fitting. *(default = 2000)* ||
|| {{{ fit_input [file] }}} || Specifies fit input file. Call multiple times to specify multiple fit geometries. ||
|| {{{ surf_descent [on|off] }}} || Only accept parameter moves that lower the square error (rather than a Monte Carlo approach). ||
|| {{{ surf_weight_constant [double] }}} || Exponential weighting factor used in surface fitting to prioritize fitting at lower potential energies. *(default = 0.5)* ||
|| {{{ surf_scale_q [double] }}} || Magnitude of charge fluctuations during surface fitting *(default = 0)* ||
|| {{{ surf_scale_r [double] }}} || Magnitude of position fluctuations of non-H2E/H2Q sites (when that site exists in multiples/doesn't apply to CoM site) *(default = 0.001)* ||

|| {{{ surf_qshift [on|off] }}} || Adjusts position of H2Q sites while adjusting charges of H2Q and H2G to remain charge neutral and conserve quadrupole. *(default = off)* ||
|| {{{ surf_global_axis [on|off] }}} || Use quaternions to rotate the molecules about the cartesian axes during surface fitting (as opposed to the local axes which is the default) *(default = off)* ||
