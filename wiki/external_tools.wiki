|| {{{ traj_pqr2pdb }}} ||
Designed a workaround for viewing long_output PQR trajectories in VMD! This is
useful for ultra-dense systems, or if you're just precision obsessed like me :D.
The shell script (traj_pqr2pdb.sh) will convert your PQR to a PDB trajectory,
which you can then read into VMD. You'll do so like this:

[user@machine]$ ./traj_pqr2pdb.sh INPUT.pqr > OUTPUT.pdb
[user@machine]$ vmd OUTPUT.pdb -e traj_pqr2pdb.vmd

More specifically, the shell script will temporarily reduce the precision of
your atomic coordinates (.6f) to .3f, and store that removed precision in
another column of the file. The PDB that is created is a readable trajectory
file by VMD. The secondary script that you load into VMD along with the PDB will
reassign the atomic coordinates of each atom, in each frame, restoring the
precision.

Note: Although the file mode bits should be preserved, the shell script should
be executable but the vmd script should not be.
