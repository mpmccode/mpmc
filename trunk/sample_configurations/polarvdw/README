Compare the energy of some configuration between bssp and polar-vdw.


First, generate the configuration from the single molecule pdb by running
mpmc generate_config.in.

Then we can calculate the energy of the system using 
mpmc energy-bssp.in
and
mpmc vdw-bssp.in




Instead of using the option "polarvdw on" we can use "polarvdw evects," to
print the matrix of eigenvectors each time we calculate the vdw energy. Recall,
that the matrix we are working with is C_ij= A_ij omega_i omega_j sqrt(alpha_i alpha_j),
however, we suppress columns and rows for which omega=0.

See vdw.c for details.
