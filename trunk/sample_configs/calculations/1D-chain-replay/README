Here we use 'ensemble replay' to read in a series of increasingly
larger 1D-chain samples (starting from 2-atoms and up to 512).

Each component of the energy is re-calcualte for each sample, for
various potential options (one sec of potential options per input
file). One may take the energy output files and process them (via scale.sh) to 
check for the small-size scalability and accuracy of our calculations.
